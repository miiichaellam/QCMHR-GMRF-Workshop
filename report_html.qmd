# Executive Summary

-   A one-day co-design workshop was hosted at the United Services Club, in Spring Hill, Brisbane, Queensland on 20 March, 2023. This workshop was attended by 27 delegates spanning several organisations.

-   The workshop contributes to an overall project aim to create and evaluate lived experience and evidence-informed video resources to assist first responders in their responses to veterans who experience suicide crisis, based on qualitative research undertaken with veterans who have experienced suicidality, their families, police and ambulance responders who respond to individuals in crisis, and input from expert stakeholders.

-   These resources will be available for use by all first responders, and other organisations who provide crisis responses to individuals who are currently serving or veterans.

-   The purpose of the workshop was to develop provisional consensus as to the target audience, learning objectives, and topics of focus of video resources and training materials to be developed, based on research undertaken and stakeholder views.

-   The day was defined by four key components: context and background; interactive activities; filming; and evaluation.

-   Findings from the day have been synthesized in this report, to produce summary recommendations pertaining to target audience, learning objectives and resources to be developed.

# Summary of Recommendations

A summary of recommendations is provided for the training materials as follows:

[Target audience]{.underline}

-   QPS front line/general duties officers

-   QAS front line staff across the organisation

-   Qld Health co-responders, MH call attendants, Acute Care Teams and Mental Health Intervention Coordinators

[Learning objectives]{.underline}

Themes around which learning objectives will be refined are:

1.  Person-centred approaches to suicide crisis situations: responding to people on worst day of their life

2.  Building connection, rapport and trust with veterans

3.  Demystifying veterans' crisis and alleviating responders bias and fear

4.  Understanding the military experience and language; understanding what it means to identity/loss of identity

5.  Referral pathways and support services

6.  Promoting help seeking behaviours post-crisis

[Video resources]{.underline}

1.  Understanding veterans experience in crisis (lived experience video)

2.  Working with veterans -- trauma informed responses (clinician/expert advice)

3.  The behavioural influence stairway model (skills, QPS, with accompanying text)

4.  Self-management, self-care, and when to seek support (Responder perspectives)

[Text resources]{.underline}

-   Referral pathways and promoting help seeking behaviours (text resources)

# Background

Suicide in veteran communities is a high profile issue of concern in veteran health. The need to improve responses to veterans who experience suicidality, and their families, is being highlighted by the current Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicides.

Suicide crises that result in a call to emergency services (police, paramedics or emergency mental health workers), represent a critical 'touchpoint' between individuals in crisis and health and social care services (WHO, 2019^1^).

In spite of this, there is scant evidence or interventions to inform optimal first responses, including first responses tailored to the specific needs of specific populations, including Defence and veteran populations.

# Project aims

The present project aims to create and evaluate lived experience and evidence-informed video and training resources to assist first responders in their responses to veterans, based on qualitative research to be undertaken with veterans who have experienced suicidality, their families, and police and ambulance responders to respond to individuals in crisis. These resources will be available for use by all first responders, and other organisations who provide crisis responses to individuals who are currently serving or veterans.

# Approach

The project is envisaged to comprise three phases: 1. Qualitative interviews and focus groups 2. Video development and 3. Evaluation. This document outlines the outcomes of phase 2 of this project, pertaining to a one-day co-design workshop, the purpose of which was to develop provisional consensus as to the target audience, learning objectives, and topics of focus of video resources and training materials, based on research undertaken and stakeholder views.

# Workshop

A one-day co-design workshop was hosted at the United Services Club, in Spring Hill, Brisbane, Queensland on 20 March, 2023. This workshop was attended by 27 delegates spanning:

-   Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research

-   Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation

-   Queensland Health

-   Queensland Police Service

-   Queensland Ambulance Service

-   Australian Defence Force

The day was defined by four key components: context and background; interactive activities; filming; and evaluation

## Context and background

Three presentations were delivered to provide context and background to the purpose of the workshop

### Presentation 1

**Suicide crisis, first responders, current and ex ADF members: current clinical services and pathways -- A/Prof Ed Heffernan**

In this presentation, A/Prof Heffernan provided an overview of the context to the videos project, in terms of rising pressures on police and paramedics to respond to individuals in crisis, and the existing service context in Queensland.

A/Prof Heffernan also noted the definition of veteran to be used for this project, as follows: "people who have any experience in the ADF including permanent, reserve, and former (ex-serving) personnel". 

### Presentation 2

**The Partners in Prevention videos project -- background, outcomes and learnings -- Dr Carla Meurk**

In this presentation, Dr Meurk overviewed the initial Partners in Prevention videos project, and discussed key learnings arising, including highlighting key considerations for filming, such as:

-   Being mindful of length, in general viewership drops substantially after 6 minutes length.

-   Consideration of what/when videos (versus text or face-to-face delivery) are the best approach e.g., the ability of videos to effectively convey emotion and connection to material through emotional connection.

-   Focus on one specific or topic or question per video

-   Video resources can be good where visual aids, diagrams, or animations can be used to convey information easily and/or in a more appropriate manner than having faces on camera.

The presentation ended with three key questions:

1.  What are our objectives for these resources?

2.  Who are they for?

3.  What is the ONE thing you want the audience to come away with for each video?

A schema of the proposed video production process, was presented, as follows:

### Presentation 3

**Training needs and gaps: Preliminary findings from qualitative interviews and focus groups with individuals with lived experience, families, and first responders -- Dr Kerri-Ann Woodbury and Dr Emina Prguda**

In this presentation, Dr Woodbury introduced phase 1 of this project, the qualitative interviews and focus groups with veterans who have been the subject of a suicide-related call to emergency services, their families, and first responders.

Dr Prguda presented the preliminary findings of the research based on six interviews and one focus groups (*n* = 10). See Table 1 for an overview of the key preliminary findings that were covered at the workshop.

*Update since the workshop*

Since the workshop, researchers have finalised data collection and the qualitative analysis for phase 1 of this project. The final sample consisted of seven veterans, one family member, and nine first responders. The final themes and subthemes are presented in Table 2. These findings will inform the development of the evidence-informed video resources. Once the findings are reviewed and approved for public dissemination, findings will be shared with the workshop participants.

## Interactive activities

Following presentations, workshop participants took part in three focussed interactive activities, with the purpose of progressing towards developing provisional consensus on the following matters:

1.  Who is/are the target audience(s) for these video resources; and

2.  What training needs will the video resources seek to meet (i.e., what are the videos aims and specific learning objectives)?

3.  What are the number, content, and broad stylistic features, including approximate length, of resources to be produced?

There were two parts to the activities: (1) brainstorming at tables, and (2) a short summative survey based on each table's consensus.

## Filming

In addition to the interactive activities, a film crew was on site for the day to obtain responses from meeting attendees for potential use in video resources. Respondents were invited to respond to the following questions:

-   When you are talking to veterans, what specific communication skills do you use to engage them?

-   What, if anything, is it that's unique about ~~a~~ veterans' in crisis?

-   What's one implementable suggestion you could give to a 1^st^ responder on how to respond to veterans' in crisis?

## Evaluation

At the end of the day, there was a preliminary discussion regarding an evaluation protocol for the project. A short survey from the day was circulated for participant feedback.

# Synthesis of Workshop Outcomes

As a means to refine the scope, answers regarding target audience, learning objectives and video topics were synthesized to identify areas of consistency and misalignment.

## Target audience

With regards to target audience, the vast majority of attendees endorsed the idea that the target audience for training should be QPS front line/general duties officers and QAS front line staff across the whole of organisation. The needs of these target audiences appeared to align with consensus around learning objectives and video topics. The next most endorsed category were QAS Emergency Medical Dispatchers, however, the prescriptive nature of this group's role, and according needs, did not appear to align with the learning objectives or topics as relevant to other groups.

Queensland Health co-responders, MH call attendants, Acute Care Teams and Mental Health Intervention Coordinators, were considered to have similar needs and therefore could be grouped together as the equivalent Queensland Health 'frontline staff'.

Other organisations, such as Australian Defence Force (ADF) and Queensland Fire Service (QFS), maybe secondary beneficiaries of resources but, based on previous learnings, expanding the target audience across too many organisations risks resources not effectively targeting any.

Consequently, a provisional recommendation for target audience was identified as follows:

-   QPS front line/general duties officers

-   QAS front line staff across the organisation

-   Qld Health co-responders, MH call attendants, Acute Care Teams and Mental Health Intervention Coordinators

## Learning objectives and video (resource) topics

Provisional consensus was achieved regarding seven thematic areas for learning objectives to be based upon. These were assessed in relation to the ten video topics identified, which also achieved high levels of consensus.

Mapping learning objectives to topics suggested, identified areas of alignment which allowed for further refinement. The table below identifies the seven learning objectives identified, and maps them to a synthesized and refined list of video topics. In this process, one learning objective was excluded, due to its not having an alignment with video topics identified. As can be seen, learning objectives map to parts of multiple video topics.

Communication and rapport building are specific components of the Behavioural Influence Stairway Model (BISM^2^), used by police negotiators. Elements of the BISM model were discussed both at roundtables, and referred to in video clips. The BISM model has been developed overtime and has become a widely established approach to crisis response and de-escalation internationally^2^. Consequently, it was recommended that one learning objective focus specifically on outlining the BISM approach.

Consequently, the following themes for learning objectives are recommended. These will be refined in the pre-production phase:

-   Person-centred approaches to suicide crisis situations, responding to people on worst day of their life

-   Building connection, rapport and trust with veterans

-   Demystifying veterans' crisis and alleviating responders bias and fear

-   Understanding the military experience and language; understanding what it means to identity/loss of identity

-   Referral pathways and support services

-   Promoting help seeking behaviours post-crisis

Following the mapping above, the following resources have been identified for production:

-   Understanding the veteran's experience in crisis (lived experience video)

-   Working with veterans -- trauma informed responses (clinician/expert advice video)

-   The behavioural influence stairway model (skills, QPS, video with accompanying text)

-   Self-management, self-care, and when to seek support (Responder perspectives, video)

-   Referral pathways and promoting help seeking behaviours (text resources)

# Proposed Consultation and Timeline

**Pre-production**

-   Circulation of workshop report to all attendees (July, 2023)

-   Project investigators and multimedia team to prepare a proposal for the format/type for each video/topic (July-August, 2023)

-   Consultation period with stakeholders, and approval by Queensland Health, Queensland Police Service, and Queensland Ambulance Service of concept developed with multimedia team (September, 2023)

**Production**

-   TBC - October-November, 2023

**Post-production**

-   November-December, 2023
